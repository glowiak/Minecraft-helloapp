# Minecraft.app
I packed Minecraft Launcher into a helloSystem Application.

# Download
Just download [this](https://github.com/glowiak/Minecraft-helloapp/releases/download/1.1-1/Minecraft.tar.bz2) file, unpack it with 'tar xjvf Minecraft.tar.bz2', and run it!

# Note!
Normally on FreeBSD you're setting java path to /usr/local/share/minecraft-client/minecraft-runtime, but in this app set java path to '[path to Minecraft.app]/Resources/minecraft-runtime'
