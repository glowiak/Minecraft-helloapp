# Minecraft.app
I packed Minecraft Launcher into a helloSystem Application. Requires openjdk8 package to be installed.

# Download
Just download [this](https://github.com/glowiak/Minecraft-helloapp/releases/download/1.0/Minecraft.zip) file, install openjdk8, unzip it to /Applications and run.

# Note!
Normally on FreeBSD you're setting java path to /usr/local/share/minecraft-client/minecraft-runtime, but in this app set java path to '/Applications/Minecraft.app/Resources/minecraft-runtime'
